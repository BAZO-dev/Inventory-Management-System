# Inventory Management System

This is a simple Inventory Management System built using **React** and **Bootstrap 5**. It helps users to manage stock, track inventory, and handle product data efficiently.

While Bootstrap 5 is used for quick and responsive design, you can also use **plain CSS** to further style and customize the user interface.
